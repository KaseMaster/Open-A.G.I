# Market Pulse AGI

A decentralized market intelligence application built on the Open AGI network that leverages collaborative AI agents to provide real-time market insights while ensuring complete user privacy and security.

## Overview

Market Pulse AGI is a revolutionary decentralized application that demonstrates the power of the Open AGI network by orchestrating specialized AI agents to produce market intelligence insights that would be impossible for a single AI system to achieve. The application ensures complete user privacy through zero-knowledge architecture and anonymous processing.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask complex market questions in plain English
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Leverages specialized AI agents for comprehensive analysis
- **Real-Time Intelligence**: Get up-to-date market insights and trends
- **Zero-Knowledge Privacy**: All processing is anonymous and encrypted
- **Beautiful Visualization**: Interactive charts and easy-to-digest reports
- **Decentralized Architecture**: No single point of failure or control

## How It Works

1. User submits a natural language query about market trends or opportunities
2. The system analyzes the query and identifies required specialized agents
3. Tasks are securely distributed to selected agents via the Open AGI network
4. Agents process their specialized portions and return encrypted results
5. A synthesis agent aggregates and validates all results
6. Final comprehensive report is generated and presented to the user

## Agent Specializations

- **Financial Data Agent**: Stock prices, economic indicators, financial news
- **News Intelligence Agent**: Breaking news, trend detection, fact verification
- **Social Media Trend Agent**: Sentiment analysis, viral content, influencer tracking
- **Competitive Intelligence Agent**: Competitor analysis, market opportunities
- **Synthesis Agent**: Result aggregation, validation, and report generation

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum smart contracts for workflow orchestration
- **AI/ML**: PyTorch, Transformers, scikit-learn for agent intelligence
- **Privacy**: TOR network, ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption, zero-knowledge processing
- **Storage**: IPFS for decentralized data storage
- **Frontend**: React with modern UI components
- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI for orchestration services

## Security and Privacy

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All communications use ChaCha20-Poly1305
- **Anonymous Processing**: TOR network integration ensures user anonymity
- **Zero Data Retention**: No personal or query data is stored
- **Decentralized Storage**: Results stored on IPFS with encrypted access
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Double Ratchet protocol for secure messaging
