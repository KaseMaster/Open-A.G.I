    - [ ] Implement simple agent discovery mechanism
    - [ ] Build basic frontend with wallet connection
    - [ ] Test end-to-end workflow with minimal functionality

## Next Steps After Completion:

Once these immediate todos are completed, the project will move into Phase 1: Core Development as outlined in the roadmap. The team will focus on:
- Developing the complete smart contract suite
- Building the backend orchestration services
- Creating the user interface with full functionality
- Establishing the agent framework foundation

This initial setup phase is critical for ensuring the project has a solid foundation for the more complex development work that follows in subsequent phases.
