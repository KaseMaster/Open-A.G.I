# Quantum Currency Implementation Beta Release

## Description

This pull request introduces the complete Quantum Currency Implementation with full OpenAGI integration. This is a major milestone that delivers a revolutionary blockchain-based currency system leveraging quantum-harmonic validation for consensus and advanced AI capabilities.

### Key Features Implemented

- **Recursive Φ-Resonance Validation (RΦV)**: Novel consensus mechanism based on quantum harmonic principles
- **Multi-Token Economy**: Five distinct tokens (FLX, CHR, PSY, ATR, RES) with unique utility functions
- **Quantum Coherence AI**: Advanced AI system for predictive analytics and autonomous orchestration
- **Hardware Security Integration**: HSM-based key management with quantum-resistant cryptography
- **Validator Staking System**: Comprehensive staking, delegation, and liquidity incentives
- **Harmonic Wallet**: Quantum-secured wallet with harmonic-validated keypair generation
- **Privacy-Preserving Transactions**: Homomorphic encryption for confidential transactions
- **Compliance Framework**: Built-in regulatory reporting and compliance mechanisms
