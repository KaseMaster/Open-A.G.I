C_mass = 3.478047e-04 [M][L]⁻⁴

### Dimensional Analysis
The dimensional pathway confirms the correct units for C_mass:

| Step | Operation           | Units                        | Result              |
| :--- | :------------------ | :--------------------------- | :------------------ |
| 1    | Mass Density Target | [M][L]⁻³                     | Reference goal      |
| 2    | Ω² Integral         | ([T]⁻¹)² × [L]³              | [T]⁻²[L]³           |
| 3    | Pre-factor (1/c²)   | [L]⁻²[T]²                    | Multiplies integral |
| 4    | Combine Units       | [L]⁻²[T]² × [T]⁻²[L]³ = [L]¹ | Residual term       |
| 5    | Solve for C_mass    | [M][L]⁻³ / [L]¹              | [M][L]⁻⁴            |

**Conclusion**: C_mass = [M][L]⁻⁴
