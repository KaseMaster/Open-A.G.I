# Quantum Coherence Economy Integration

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the Inter-System Quantum Integration & Coherence Economy Activation as part of Phases 6 and 7 of the Quantum Currency Framework. The coherence economy transforms all system-level harmonics into measurable, exchangeable, and regenerative economic frequencies across network layers.

## Implementation Details

### Cross-System Quantum Integration Layer

The integration layer ensures interoperability between independent coherence clusters:
- Implementation of `src/network/quantum_bridge.py` using WebSocket harmonics
- Secure Ω-vector data transfer across validator networks
- Cross-chain synchronization for inter-system validation

### Coherence Economy Engine (CEE)

The CEE activates reciprocal flow between CHR, PSY, and FLX tokens:
- Implementation in `src/economy/coherence_exchange.py`
- Ψ normalization filters to maintain harmonic conservation
- Validator bridge protocol in `src/consensus/interchain_validator.py`

### Quantum Integration Daemon (QID)

The QID provides inter-network coherence signaling:
- Continuous monitoring of coherence states across connected systems
- Real-time adjustment of Ψ-balancing heuristics
- Cross-chain message integrity verification

## Ψ-Balancing Heuristics

Implementation of Ψ-balancing across tokenized layers:
- Entropy control ensuring entropy ≤ 0.002
- Variance minimization across connected systems
- Automatic adjustment mechanisms for coherence drift

## Integration Testing

Comprehensive integration tests have been implemented:
- `tests/integration/test_quantum_bridge.py`
- `tests/integration/test_coherence_economy.py`

## Security Considerations

Security measures for Ω-vector data transfer:
- Encryption with harmonic salts
- Homomorphic key isolation
- Non-invertibility of Ω state vectors

## Performance Metrics

Key performance indicators for the coherence economy:
- Coherence Score ≥ 0.97
- Entropy Rate ≤ 0.002
- H_internal ≥ 0.98
- CAF ≥ 1.05

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced predictive analytics for coherence economy optimization
- Machine learning models for automated Ψ-balancing
- Enhanced cross-chain communication protocols
