### System Architecture

The implementation creates a complete autonomous governance system:

```
[Quantum Coherence AI] → [AGI Coordinator] ← [Reinforcement Policy]
                              ↓
                    [Consensus Parameters] ← [Predictive Coherence]
                              ↓
                    [Network Implementation] → [Monitoring Dashboard]
```
